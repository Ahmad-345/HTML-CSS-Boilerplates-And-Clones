# Simple Projects
This Repository contains ready to go Boilerplates that can be used in in other projects instead of creating the same building blocks functionalities again and again. This is to speed up the development process, make the code more tested and trusted as used before and make the overall project more effecient, integral and secure. This Repository also contains some clones of different websites rather popular which helps to ressemble new ideas with other renowened existing projects which really makes the development of the basic setup of new projects easy, organized and productive. It also helps overall while working with projects anyway.
